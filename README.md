# Multi-Agent Website & App Development with CrewAI (Sample / Beta Version)

Orchestrate a full-stack CrewAI team that transforms high-level product briefs
into implementation-ready blueprints for websites and mobile apps. The crew
handles architectural design, component planning, design-system guidance, and
backlog generation so you can move from concept to build with confidence.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 – 3.13
- A Gemini API key (or compatible model key) with access rights for the selected model in .env
- uv, pip, or your preferred package installer

## Setup
1. **Create a virtual environment** (Already done):
   `ash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   `
2. **Install dependencies**:
   `ash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   `
3. **Configure environment variables**:
   - Copy .env to hold local secrets.
   - Set GEMINI_API_KEY to your regenerated key.

## To run:
Type the command `uv sync` and `crewai run` in the terminal to run this project.


Outputs include:
- {module_name}_design.md – design spec from the engineering lead.
- {module_name} – backend module generated by the coding agent.
- app.py – prototype Gradio interface.
- test_{module_name} – unit tests targeting the generated module.


## To run the project created by CrewAI:
Type `uv sync` and `uv run python output\app.py` in the terminal.
