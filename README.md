# Multi-Agent Website & App Development with CrewAI (Sample / Beta Version)

Orchestrate a full-stack CrewAI team that transforms high-level product briefs
into implementation-ready blueprints for websites and mobile apps. The crew
handles architectural design, component planning, design-system guidance, and
backlog generation so you can move from concept to build with confidence.

## Note
This is a sample / beta version only and has to be heavily modified if you wish to
deploy Professional and Industrial projects. This version is helpful for students who
are looking to build demos and prototypes. If you wish a more advanced version, please
contact me on luvlohano@gmail.com
